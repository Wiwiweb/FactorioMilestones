---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.6

Date: 2024-03-03

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.24

    - Fixed consumption milestones not being backfilled properly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.22
Date: 2024-01-24
  Features:
    - Added new milestone types "item_consumption" and "fluid_consumption", which trigger on consumption rather than production. This has some niche uses for some modpacks.
      Because of the niche use, these can't be added via the settings GUI yet. You can add them in presets or with the import feature.
    - Added a player mod setting to allow hiding all incomplete milestones.
    - Added a "Reset" button in the settings GUI, to reset your settings back to the auto-detected set (preset + addons).

  Changes:
    - Infinite milestones marked as "hidden" will now only have the initial milestone hidden. Milestones created from the infinite milestone's completion will be visible.
    - Added a small text to fill the space when no milestones are visible at all, to make it look more intentionally empty.
    - Marked the selected preset name with "(Modified)" if the current set has been modified compared to the preset.
    - Preset updates:
      - Marked all character kills as "hidden".
      - SEK2 preset: Changed science pack order to account for recent SEK2 changes.
      - PyMods presets: Added Guar and Arqad Queen milestones, and fixed Phaidaisus milestones.
      - IR3 preset: Fixed petrochemical generator milestone.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.21
Date: 2023-12-26
  Features:
    - Milestones presets can now mark milestones as "hidden". These milestones are still tracked but will only appear in the GUI after they are reached.

  Changes:
    - Small additions to SE default presets: Added a couple hidden milestones for a couple spoilers. Removed "(No spoilers)" from the name of the presets. The name change will cause a "detected a new preset" message on save file load, but you can ignore it.
    - Small additions to PyMods default presets: Added burner assembler 1 and splitter.

  Scripting:
    - A custom event is now fired when a milestone is reached. Use the new remote interface to get the custom event ID: remote.call("milestones", "get_on_milestone_reached_event"). Thanks to Ziro2k for the idea and code inspiration.
    - Milestones can now write reached milestones to a text file in the script output folder. This can be useful for external programs. This is off by default, check the new "Write milestones to file" player setting for details.

  Locale:
    - Added Czech translation thanks to Bakendrid.
    - Translation updates for French and Chinese.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed turning off an infinite milestone in settings not actually applying the change.
    - Fixed milestones added as part of an infinite milestone not editing the right milestone when trying to edit the estimation time.

  Compatibility:
    - Presets provided via remote interface now have priority over default presets. This means other mods can override default presets.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.19
Date: 2023-07-14
  Changes:
    - Removed built-in Sea Block presets, in favor of Sea Block's own preset provided by their mod.

  Locale:
    - Added Spanish translation thanks to Frodo45127.
    - Added Polish translation thanks to wuka.
    - Updated Japanese translation thanks to YAMATO_Hajime.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.18
Date: 2023-05-20
  Features:
    - Added "Disable milestone notifications" mod setting which turns off chat notifications. This is a player setting, so each player can have it set the way they want.

  Locale:
    - Updated Japanese translation thanks to nojio.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.17
Date: 2023-04-09

  Locale:
    - Russian translation update thanks to Shadow_Man.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Fix Bob's Modules preset addon being loaded when using Bob's Enemies instead.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.14
Date: 2023-01-27
  Changes:
    - Tweaks to IR3 preset (Added Heavy picket, graphene, and electrum. Replaced special projects pack end goal count with a technology milestone, since productivity in labs can actually make the required number of packs variable).
    - Tweaks to PyMods presets (Added Dig-o-saurus, Thikat, Caravan, and Oculus)
    - Large changes to the Sea Block presets with input from the Sea Block community.
    - Add preset addon for the "Cat" mod.
    - As usual you will need to refresh your milestone set yourself if you are already in the middle of a playthrough (Settings -> Switch to Empty -> Switch to the preset you want -> Confirm).

  Optimizations:
    - Milestone checks are now spread over every tick of the frequency interval (the "Ticks between each check" mod setting) instead of happening all at once. This should solve spikes of performance hit when playing with a large amount of milestones.

  Compatibility:
    - You can now have your mod provide presets and preset addons by implementing a `milestones_presets` or `milestones_preset_addons` remote interface.
      Please check out the comments in presets.lua and preset_addons.lua for more details.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fix GUI sometimes being too wide for the screen when using Compact mode. (Again!)
    - Fix settings GUI "Add X" buttons states being wrong when changing preset.
    - Fix settings GUI selection state being wrong after moving a selected line.
    - Fix issue where technologies that end with a number (e.g. "Electronics 3") would be considered researched during backfilling even if they were not.

  Locale:
    - Chinese translation thanks to luaotix.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.12

  Bugfixes:
    - Fix GUI sometimes being too wide for the screen when using Compact mode. 
      Also, the GUI will now try to fit within 90% of the screen width instead of trying to use as much of the screen as possible.

  Locale:
    - Locale updates for 1.3.10 strings.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.11
Date: 2022-11-09

      As usual you will need to refresh your milestone set yourself if you are already in the middle of a PyMods playthrough (Settings -> Switch to Empty -> Switch to the preset you want -> Confirm).
    - Add preset addon for Fluidic Power (Thanks to stringweasel)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.8
Date: 2022-09-13
  Features:
    - Add beta support for item aliases. You can indicate to Milestones that an item is worth a certain amount of another item.
      - This is designed for Nullius's science, which can be created individually or as a "box" item worth several science packs. Up until now the Nullius milestones were not accurate because of these 2 ways to create science.
      - For now there is no way to create aliases via the settings GUI. You can modify aliases using the export/import feature.
    - Add mod setting to hide the "±Xm" estimations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.6
Date: 2022-08-15
  Changes:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.2

  Bugfixes:
    - Fix crash with mods that create items before the start of the game. 

  Locale:
    - Locale updates from Crowdin.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 2022-06-07
  Features:
    - Now requires Factorio 1.1.60 or above.
    - Greatly improved estimations accuracy when added to an existing game. Milestones can now use production statistics directly to backfill completed milestones.
      - Accuracy is greater for more recent completion times. Expect ±5 minutes for 50 hours games, ±25m for 250h, ±1h40 for 1000h.
      - Editing estimation ranges is now only available for inaccurate estimations (>1hour uncertainty), and now work by just typing the time instead of typing "x minutes ago". This makes more sense now that you won't have to copy values from production statistics.
      - In existing games: Leftover estimations will be replaced with the new more accurate estimations. Estimations that had already been edited with typed-in times won't be touched.
    - Add milestone groups. You can create arbitrary categories, and milestones will appear grouped under these categories.
      - You can switch back to the old chronological view with the new mod setting "List by group".
    - Add preset for 248k Mod (Thanks to PreLeyZero!)

  Changes:
    - Updated presets to use milestone groups. Existing games won't be updated unless you reload them from the preset.
    - Milestones settings can now only be changed by admins, instead of relying on "Mod Settings Changed" permissions. This seems to match with Factorio's own conditions on modifying Mod Settings.
    - Changing the settings in a multiplayer game will now indicate who did the change in the chat message.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fix crash when the GUI was cleared through another mod or command.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2022-02-20
  Features:
    - Infinite Milestones: 
      You can now set a "next" value for a milestone. When that milestone is completed, a new milestone is automatically created at a higher count, depending on that "next" value. 
      Example: "1000 science packs, next: x10" would create "10000 science packs" when completed, then "100000 science packs", etc. You can also use "+" for adding instead of multiplying.
    - You can now export or import encoded milestone sets (for a shorter, but non-human-readable string).
    - New "Compact list" Player Mod Setting, removes the "Completed at:" labels from the main view. Defaults to off.

  Changes:
    - Change presets to use infinite milestones. Existing sets won't be updated unless you reload them from the preset.
